    Pauses test execution after OPP configuration for debugging purposes.

    This step allows operators to:
    - Inspect the cluster state after OPP bundle installation
    - Run oc commands interactively
    - Debug OPP integration issues (Quay, ACS, ODF, ACM)
    - Wait for manual verification before proceeding

    The step will wait for a configurable time period (default: 2 hours)
    or until a specific condition is met. During this time, the cluster
    remains available for inspection via oc commands.

    Environment Variables:
    - WAIT_DURATION: Time to wait in seconds (default: 7200 = 2 hours)
    - WAIT_MESSAGE: Custom message to display during wait
